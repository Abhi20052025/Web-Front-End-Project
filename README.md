## Project Overview

**FortunaCySec Clone** is a modern, responsive React web application built using **component-based architecture**. The project emphasizes a **modular, maintainable codebase**.

By leveraging **React Hooks** such as `useState` and `useEffect`, the app efficiently manages complex UI states, including:

* Dynamic **tab switching** in the Resources section.
* **Real-time screen-size detection** for responsive layout adjustments.
* Interactive UI components (buttons, forms, hover effects) without using external state libraries.

This allows for **high performance and scalability** while keeping the code simple and clean.

---

## Features

* **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular React components for every UI section (Hero, Services, Events, Resources, Contact).
* **Dynamic State Management**: Hooks handle all UI interactions, state changes, and responsive behaviors.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* **Resources Section**: Dynamic tab-based content switching.
* **Animations**: Smooth transitions using **Framer Motion** and **GSAP**.
* **Media Integration**: Embeds videos using **React Player**.
* **API Requests**: Managed via **Axios** (if needed for future enhancements).
* **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Easily hosted live at [https://Abhi20052025.github.io/Web-Front-End-Project/](https://Abhi20052025.github.io/Web-Front-End-Project/).

## Technologies Used

* **React 19** – Component-based frontend
* **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern JS features
* **CSS / SCSS** – Styling and responsive layouts
* **Framer Motion & GSAP** – Animations and transitions
* **React Router** – Client-side routing
* **Axios** – API requests
* **GitHub Pages** – Hosting live site

---

## How It Works

1. **Component-Based UI**: Each UI element is a separate React component for reusability.
2. **Dynamic State Management**:

   * `useState` tracks interactive elements and user inputs.
   * `useEffect` detects screen size changes and updates layout in real-time.
3. **Responsive Tabs**: Resources section switches content without page reloads.
4. **Animations**: Hover effects and section transitions enhance user experience.
